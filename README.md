#Student names: Fajer Alamro , Aljawharah Alsobaie, Rama Alomair, Mashael Alammar, Layal Alghamdi.

#Project motivation: These data have drawn our attention to the fact that heart attacks have become increasingly prevalent, which in turn has led to several negative consequences. Therefore, understanding the factors contributing to this alarming trend could help individuals and healthcare professionals develop more effective prevention strategies. Studying and analyzing our data will help us identify the main factors that lead to heart attacks, and by identifying these factors, we aim to facilitate preventive measures, ultimately reducing the incidence of heart attacks and improving public health outcomes.
